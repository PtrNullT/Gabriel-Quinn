                The majority of the story's plot revolves around Gabriel and the Samaritan Bay Disaster.
                Gabriel being the cause of said disaster and the majority of the story is just him observing the aftermath, feeling guilty 
                especially since this led to the deaths of his family. 
                Though eventually reconciling with himself and the remaining residents of Samaritan Bay.

            <p class="paragraph-center">
                what the story portrays is comparable to real life events
                and similar environmental disasters we have experienced ourselves:
                ... big Corporations messing up and causing environmental disasters
                like the one in the story, and sometimes they are not willing to take full responsibility
                and/or it's already too late to solve.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph-center">
                Gabriel's character is a classic. He has a poor mental state at the start, 
                depression, guilt, regrets from his past actions are the push factors to his initial suicide motives.
                This example also occurs within real life and King is just bringing that into the novel.
