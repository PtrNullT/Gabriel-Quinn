                The majority of the story's plot revolves around Gabriel and his emotions 
                follwing the Samaritan Bay Disaster. After Gabriel causes The Ruin, he feels guilt
                for his actions and the story shows his guilt and observing of the aftermath. 
                The story also shows his path of attempting to reconcile with himself, and the community of Samaritan Bay.

            <p class="paragraph-center">
                The story is comparable to real life events and similar environmental disasters we see regularly in our world today. 
                We used our movie trailer to compare ideas in the book to large corporations causing environmental disasters. 
                We also used elements of film to portray an idea of the neglect these companies have for their actions.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph-center">
                Gabriel has a broad depth of character, he has a poor mental state at the start, depression,
                guilt, and regret for his past actions. These lead into his initial suicide motives. 
                Our short film will portray these ideas and take a dive into the character of Gabriel.
